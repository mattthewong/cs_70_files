# Homework 1

# Overview
In this assignment, you'll think and write about the differences between Java and C++. You'll also get to read, modify, compile, execute, and test some C++ code.

# Reading
Before you begin, you should look at the following readings:
* Chapter 1 and Sections 3.1-3.2 of the *C++ Primer*.

# Steps
There are five Issues to complete for this assignment:

* Written Style Part
* Written C++ Part
* Coding Part
* Testing Part
* Checking your submission

# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 10 points: correctness
* 15 points: completeness
* 5 points: style 
* 5 points: elegance
* 5 points: clarity 
* 10 points: peer review

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2015/Admin/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories. 

The grutors will also provide written comments on your code's style and elegance.

# Resources 
* See the *[GitHub How To](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Repository) wiki page* for details on how to set up this assignment. 
* The repository for this assignment includes code in Python, Java, and C++. Before you start the Coding part, you should confirm that you can compile and run the Java and c++ versions of the `palindrome` and `shuffle` code. Review the [Compiling Code](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/wiki/CompilingHowTo) wiki page for details on how to do that. You don't have to submit anything for this part, but in future assignments we will assume you know how to compile and run C++ code.
* Help each other out! If you have resources or tips for other teams, add them to the [Hints and Tips](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/wiki/HW1-Hints-Tips) page for this assignment. 

# Helpful Hints
* *Pair Programming:* Remember, your must work on the following as a pair, including the written part.  You can (and should) read this assignment writeup and think about it before you meet, however.
* *Commit Early, Commit Often:* Remember to check in your files regularly!  In particular, don't forget to check them in when you're finished.
* As a general rule (even outside CS 70!), *you should not add generated files* of any form (e.g., compiled code, PDFs made from LaTeX, etc) to a repository when those files can be automatically produced from files already in the repository. 
* *Doxygen:* The C++ files are commented in `Doxygen` format. `Doxygen` is a tool that can automatically generate HTML or LaTeX documentation from C++ files. In future assignments, we will ask you to write your own Doxygen comments and to use Doxygen to generate documentation. For now, it's important only that you keep all the comments in your code up to date. You don't need to worry too much about the format of Doxygen comments in your code, nor do you need to generate Doxygen documentation.
