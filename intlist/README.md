# Overview
In this assignment, you'll implement a singly-linked list class that has capabilities in-between the C++ STL types `std::forward_list<int>` and `std::list<int>`. 
Your list class will also define an iterator, so that users of the class can iterate over all the elements of the list.

After you've implemented your list, you'll analyze its performance  for a number of different operations.

# Reading
In addition to the class wiki notes, you should look through the following before starting this assignment:
* The [Documentation for C++'s iterators](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/)
