# Homework 3

## Overview

On knuth (and many other machines), if you accidentally type `sl` instead of `ls`, you will get a big surprise!
Try it out for yourself and see what happens.
This combination of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) art and animation is known as ASCIImation.

Over the next two assignments, youâ€™ll have a chance to implement a system for showing ASCIImation and you'll design your own ASCIImation creation.

In this first half of the assignment, you will also create a Makefile, which will make compiling larger programs (made up of more files) much easier. 

## Reading

We suggest focusing specifically on the following sections of the *C++ Primer* textbook this week:
* Sections 3.5.1-3.5.2 for a review of primitive arrays
* Section 7.1.2 for different ways to define member functions
* Section 8.2 to better understand the file-reading code in the starter code

## Reference diagram

Refer to this diagram to help you understand how the `Sprite` is drawn on the screen:
